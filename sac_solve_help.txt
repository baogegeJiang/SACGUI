Part One

this program tries to provide a way similar with SAC to users in matlab. 
you can use part of SAC's commands. for example, use 'n' to plot next 
several figures, as well as 'b'; use 'f' 'p' 's' to pick phase; use 'x' 
to magnify figures, as well as 'o'. 'USE' means key press.

to get start, you can push on 'browser & add' to select sac files. you can 
add different sac files in more than one time; you can also add more than 
one sac files in a time; 

then the sacfiles you select will show in 'sacfile list'; if you want to 
clear the list, choose the box and press 'c' in your keybroad. 'c' will 
also work with the 'state' box.the 'state' box will show you some 
information of the process. the blank box in which you can type words. 
you can run command in the program.

press 'w' to write the already changed sacfile. if you choose 'write over', 
 new ones will replace the old ones; otherwise, the new one will saved in 
the work directory with name as {original name}_temp.
